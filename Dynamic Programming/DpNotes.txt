													DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING NOTES:

-State of DP: Set of all the parameter which tells us the its repeating itself or identifies sub-problems.
	     				It help us to identify the dimension of dp if state of dp is 1 then we require 1-D dp atmost if its 2 the we require 2-D dp atmost. 
-Optimal Sub-structure: Its referred as when we use small problem solution to solve a bigger sub-problem optimally.

-Dp is optimization technique:
